## Abstract
<details>
  <summary>Detail</summary>
  
   In an age where security systems are becoming increasingly advanced, traditional lock mechanisms often fall short in terms of user-friendliness and accessibility, especially to those who are visually challenged. Sound-triggered locks represent a novel approach to security by leveraging acoustic recognition technology. This innovation allows users to unlock their doors using specific sound patterns, such as claps, enhancing both convenience and security.

The motivation behind this project stems from the need for intuitive security solutions that reduce reliance on keys and other physical security measures, which can be lost or stolen. By incorporating a sound recognition system, we aim to create a more seamless interaction between users and their security devices. This solution not only caters to tech-savvy individuals but also serves those with physical limitations who may find traditional locks difficult.

Our unique contribution involves the development of a sound-triggered lock system with several key features: it verifies input patterns to ensure only authorised individuals can unlock it, allows users to reset their sound-based passwords easily, and implements a safety mechanism that locks the system after three incorrect attempts. Additionally, The new password must have at least five claps in the password sequence separated by at least 1 pause in between, enhancing security and complexity. This project not only showcases the potential of sound-based security solutions but also paves the way for future innovations in smart locking mechanisms, making everyday interactions with security systems more intuitive and efficient.
