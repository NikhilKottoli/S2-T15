## Abstract
<details>
  <summary>Detail</summary>
  
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a public-key cryptosystem that has high efficiency and security. Our unique contribution lies in the introduction of a hybrid approach that combines traditional ECC methods with efficient point multiplication techniques to minimizeDiffie-Hellman. 

Traditional cryptographic systems require larger key sizes to provide equivalent security, which leads to greater computational overhead, increased energy consumption, and higher bandwidth usage. ECC, by comparison, provides the same level of security with significantly smaller key sizes, making it an ideal solution for such constrained environments.

we  design and implement an optimized ECC system that further reduces computational complexity and improves performance for key exchange and encryption processes. Our unique contribution lies in the introduction of a hybrid approach that combines traditional ECC methods with efficient point multiplication techniques to minimize the time complexity of cryptographic operations.
